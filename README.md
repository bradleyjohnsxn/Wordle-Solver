# Wordle-Solver

To use the program, run 'solver.cpp.'

1. Enter the number of letters in the word (normally 5).
2. Enter the green letters in their position. (If the 2nd and 4th letter are 'a' and 'b', then type '-a-b-'.)
3. Enter the yellow letters in their position. (If there are overlapping yellow letters, then type them in 2 different entries. When done with the yellow, then type 'end' to move on.)
4. Type all the grey letters on one line. (If 'c', 'd', and 'l' are grey, then enter 'cdl'.)
5. Outputs appear. If the wordle is solved, then type 'n' to not continue. Else, if the wordle is not solved, then type 'y' to continue, and you only have to enter the new green, yellow, and grey letters.
6. When the wordle is solved, type 'y' if there is another wordle to solve, or type 'n' to end the program.
